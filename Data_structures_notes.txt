Data structures:
array[]
    Java - homogenous containers
    Python - heterogenous containers
contiguous data structure - all values are next to each other
or use pointers to access data stored in different places

linked list - self referential object
Linear data structure where each element of the list is contained in a separate object called a node
    a node models 2 pieces of info - an item of the data we want to store and a reference to the next element in the list
    head node - first node
    tail node - last node
Doubly linked list stores reference to the node before and the next node

inserting data is more efficient - only true if inserting at head or tail - called prepend(head) or append(tail)

insert - just need to change references to nodes to insert data - constant time but*
    finding position of where you want to insert is linear time


Merge Sort:
splits arrays in half until all single element arrays, then sorts while merging back doublng each time
